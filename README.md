#Walk with me | Meet Dublin
It's my first project based on a webiste aimed to show the city of Dublin going on walking tours.

##Description
The website has the homepage as introduction of the concept.
2 other pages; 1 with day walks and 1 with night tours, where the user can pick areas to visit, time and language of the tour.
About us and contact page where the user can leave comments, feeback, etc.

###Images
All images come from getty images and unsplash private accounts. 

###UX
The user needs to find a tour that he or she likes and book it.
When enabled, a calendar should pop-up when clicking "book your walk" button.
I tried to create a uniform style (colours and layout) thoughout all pages.

The form in the contact page means to be simple and to the point.
When enabled, a "sent confirmation message" should appear when submitting the form.

###Features
####1. For the tour booking pages I used cards to present the different walk choices.
The cards have a simple design with a clearly visible button with the CTA.
They have also an intro text above to explain the user what to expect.
####2. The about us and contact page are built with 2 block. Un with text explaining about the page and one with a form for the user to fill out to contact with a choice of specific reasons.

###Technologies 
I used code from Bootstrap 4 and CSS editing.
I used Font awesome.
I took some inspiration from previous projects from the course.

###Process
I created the index page first and when I had it ready as a template for heading and footer I created the contact page.
The contact page i taking a while to have the content fitting the background image or should I make the image to fit the content?
This part is taking me a while to figure out.

Day and night tour pages are built last. One I have the day walk tours created, the night walk tours will be very similar 
in terms of layout.

I ended up changing back to my original idea of 2 section per page (except homepage).
This way images and cards are all responsive.

###Testing
After much researching and tweaking, I was not able to solve the problem of adjusting an image background to smaller screen size.

###Deployment
I uploaded all the work to my github account.

It has taking me a while to come up with the concept and start with it.
It's common for me to hesitate at first but once I have the basic structure created, I'm confident I won't stop.

Getting used to editing the bootstrap code and getting used to the grid it ws a bit harder than expected.
Tons of twicks and backs and forths.

Working full time and being a full time time while tryig to do this project is very challenging.
I'm struggling with time, energy and concentration.
I must find my pace.

I mananged to finish the project but I'm not fully satisafied.
As mentioned above there are some responsive issues I think I'll be able to solve them further along the line as I progress with the course.
